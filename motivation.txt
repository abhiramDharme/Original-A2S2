We chose to create a version of GeoGuessr,
based right here in our beautiful campus.
We named our brainchild IITDGuessr.

The idea to create such a game arose
when we randomly visited Google Earth
one day and found out that the images
of our campus were severely outdated.
In our original campus tour upon onboarding,
we were taken to only the major locations
and left to find new spots for ourselves.
This, coupled with our fascination with
geography when we were younger, gave us
the idea for IITDGuessr.

After speaking to a few people, we found
out that a significant percentage of
campus junta only know about important
locations and have never explored places
like the Residential Area and the R&I Park.
We wanted to open up these people's perspectives
and show them that our campus is a place
worth exploring.

IITDGuessr, created by Sabhya Khurana and
Abhiram Sanjay Dharme, encourages players to look
at small details in images to figure out where
they are. We have also added a local 1-v-1 mode, 
fueled by us enjoying such games with our
siblings when we were children.

For the truly adventurous, we have also added
a real world element, in which you have to 
actually navigate to the marked location and 
then mark it to get points. For this, we update 
the location in real-time to track you.

This game caters to all audiences, giving the
onboarding freshers and new students a campus
tour and helping the older students find
fresh sites inside IIT Delhi.
