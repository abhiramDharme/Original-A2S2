IITD-Guessr:

Motivation and Social Cause for the IITD-Guesser Game:

The motivation behind creating a university 
campus-specific geo-guesser game is rooted in 
understanding the unique challenges faced by 
introverted students in a highly competitive 
academic environment. Introverts often find 
social interaction and adaptation to large, 
bustling environments daunting. This game is 
crafted to encourage a sense of familiarity 
and comfort with the campus in a fun, low-pressure 
manner. By turning campus exploration into a game, 
we aim to help introverted students feel more at 
home in their university environment, facilitating 
easier integration into campus life and reducing 
feelings of isolation.

Multiplayer Feature:
To further enhance its impact, the game includes 
a multiplayer mode designed to foster interaction 
among students in a controlled and supportive setting. 
This feature enables introverted students to have 
interaction with peers through shared tasks within the 
game, providing a platform for interaction that respects 
their need for more manageable social engagement. 
It's a strategic way to encourage communication and 
build friendships without the stress of face-to-face 
encounters, making it an ideal medium for introverts 
to begin forming connections.

Social Cause:
Aligned with the cause of mental health awareness 
and support, this game addresses the critical issues 
of depression and anxiety prevalent among university 
students. The high-pressure academic atmosphere can 
significantly affect students' mental health, 
sometimes leading to severe consequences like 
depression or even suicide. This game serves as a 
preventive tool, aiming to mitigate these risks by 
promoting a familiar and interactive campus environment.

Choice of Topic:
The focus on mental health was chosen due to the 
alarming rates of mental health issues such as 
depression and anxiety observed on campus. Familiarity 
with one's environment can significantly impact one's 
sense of security and stress levels. For students who 
find personal interactions challenging, this virtual 
exploration tool can act as a precursor to physical 
exploration, boosting their confidence and feelings 
of belonging.
